With all those security breaches happening lately, you have to get on top of all the credentials you use online. Plex, Twitter, Facebook and Desjardins (yup, it’s a bank) are just a few corporations that have at least one of its services compromised, and that is putting you even more at risk if you’re using the same credentials everywhere. Someone may be able to use the leaked information to create new accounts on your behalf or even worse, get access to your current accounts. One of the simplest ways to protect yourself is to make sure that you don’t reuse passwords but I hear you — you’re already complaining about having to remember all those different security questions when you still can’t remember what you had for breakfast this morning. This is where having a password manager comes into play — you can delegate all this stuff to a piece of software! Grandma may be using the same password everywhere but today, we’ll make sure that changes for good.

# Advantages
There’s a lot of them — and even if you don’t find anything that appeals to you in there, you should still try to give it a shot.

- Keep all your credentials in the same place, but **hidden** to malicious eyes
- Automatically generates new, **secure passwords** for you
- Works across **all your devices**, from mobiles to your computer(s)
- Can be **shared** with a trusted individual

# Requirements
There’s not much to be prepared for here, as most password managers are meant to be used by everyone. That being said, we can’t speak for every single one of them, and you should make sure that the solution that you end up with has all the features/requirements that you will need down the road.

Personally, coming from the Apple side of things, I’ve tried to use a bunch of them in the past years — but I’m always coming back to [1Password](https://1password.com/). It’s one of the pioneers and has been around for ages, so is one of the default go-to for multiple people. I know it may sound like it, but I’m not sponsored by anyway, I just truly think it’s a great product that is easy to use and that never failed me for all the years I’ve been using it.

# Getting started
## What solution to choose?
Over the last few years, I’ve jumped from a solution to another, but I always came back to the one I was using in college — [1Password](https://1password.com/). It’s not free, but I feel that the $10/month is well worth its price, especially with the possibility of sharing vaults with my loved ones. It simply **works on all my devices** (from smart phones to tablets and laptop) and **stupid easy** to set up. There’s a bunch of free solutions out there (even some that are self hosted if you’re into that), but I would strongly suggest that you review their security and privacy statements before you decide to dive in — we’re talking about all your credentials/passwords after all!

Here’s a few that I remember off the top of my head to help you drive your decision:

| Name | Price | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [1Password](https://1password.com/) | $10/month | |
| [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) | Free |  |
| [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) | Free | Self-hosted |
| [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) | Free | Self-hosted |
| [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/) | $5/month | |
| [Enpass](https://www.enpass.io/) | $12 | One-time fee |
| [iCloud Keychain](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT204085) | Free | Apple only |
| [Google Passwords](https://passwords.google.com/) | Free | Google only |
| [NordPass](https://nordpass.com/) | $2.49/month | |

Prices are in USD and may vary depending on the plan you choose.

# Features to look for
## Ease of use
It’s the easiest way to store and use strong passwords everywhere. With [1Password](https://1password.com/), you only ever need to memorize one password and all the other ones are getting protected by it, which only you know about. All your logins and documents are securely stored in your vaults — this help keep your information locked away from thieves, hackers and other unsavoury types.

It can also automagically record your credentials when you sign into apps (on your phone/tablet) and websites. It even has an automatic form filler that helps log into online accounts with a single click, or touch.

## Security & Privacy
When looking for a password manager, obviously security should always come first — again, you have to keep telling yourself that this thing will end up dealing with all your stuff. If, like me, you’re already pretty much into the Apple ecosystem, you probably want a native solution that integrates well with all (if not most) Apple technologies — which brings me to [1Password](https://1password.com/) again.

When it comes to privacy, [1Password](https://1password.com/) ‘s been a pioneer and always been upfront. I won’t go into too much detail here, but just know that privacy and security is one of the most important things you should worry about here, and you can find their privacy policy directly on their website.

One last thing (see what I did there) — they created a thing they call [Watchtower](https://watchtower.1password.com/). It basically keeps track of password breaches and other security problems for you, so you can keep your accounts and credentials safe. It’ll check for weak, compromised, or duplicate passwords and let you know which sites are missing two-factor authentication or even using the unsecured HTTP protocol. It’s a great way to keep track of all your accounts and make sure that you’re not using the same password everywhere.

## Sharing
This is a big one for me, as I’m using it to share some of my credentials with my girlfriend. It’s a great way to share your Netflix account, for example, without having to give away your password. You can also use it to share your bank account credentials with your spouse, so you can both access it without having to remember the password. It’s also a great way to share your credentials with your family in case something happens to you — they’ll be able to access your accounts and take care of everything for you.

# Recap
As you can see, having a password manager is something that many people are starting to look into, and you defectively should too. In this world where we do and access everything online, this will help you keep your accounts safe. Are you the kind of person that would you leave all your passwords on a piece of paper somewhere or even worse — using the same ones everywhere?
